/**
 * A RelativeLocation is a vector of integers that
 * express a relative location in a coordinate system; this
 * is generally used in an MPI Cartesian Topology. A vector
 * might look like:
 *
 *   [ -1, -1, 1 ]
 *
 * which would indicate one unit to the 'left' in the x dimension,
 * one to the 'left' in the y dimension, and one to the 'right'
 * in the z dimension.
 *
 * This class can be 'incremented' so that it advances
 * through a series of relative locations in a fixed and
 * predictable order. The boundaries can be customized
 * so that the range of possible values in any dimension
 * is settable; by default it is [-1, 1] (inclusive) in
 * all dimensions, meaning, roughly, 'left, center, right'.
 * However, different values can be used, e.g.:
 *
 * minima: [-2, -1, -2]
 * maxima: [1, 2, 3]
 *
 * This would describe a volume of space ranging from -2 to 1
 * in the x dimension, -1 to 2 in the y dimension, and -2 to 3
 * in the z dimension. A typical use when incrementing would
 * be to start at the lowest value [-2, -1, -2] and loop
 * through all possible variants:
 *
 *  [ -2, -1, -2 ]
 *  [ -1, -1, -2 ]
 *  [  0, -1, -2 ]
 *  [  1, -1, -2 ]
 *  [ -2,  0, -2 ]
 *  [ -1,  0, -2 ]
 *  [  0,  0, -2 ]
 *  [  1,  0, -2 ]
 *  [ -2,  1, -2 ]
 *  [ -1,  1, -2 ]
 *  [  0,  1, -2 ]
 *  [  1,  1, -2 ]
 *  [ -2,  2, -2 ]
 *  [ -1,  2, -2 ]
 *  [  0,  2, -2 ]
 *  [  1,  2, -2 ]
 *  [ -2, -1, -1 ]
 *  [ -1, -1, -1 ]
 *  [  0, -1, -1 ]
 *  [  1, -1, -1 ]
 *  ...
 *  [  0,  2,  3 ]
